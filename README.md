## History and differences with Microsoft Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ

The Azure Toolkit for [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) is a fork of
the [Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/intellij/azure-toolkit-for-intellij-installation),
available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-tools-for-java).

Microsoft's Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ provides similar functionality to the Azure plugin
for [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider), however, focus on the Java/JVM ecosystem and development flows.
JetBrains decided to fork the original plugin, and split base functionality (such as browsing Azure resources) from
Java/JVM-specific features (such as deploying a `.war` file to the HDInsight service).

The Azure Toolkit for [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) is released with several notable differences:

* No telemetry or usage data is collected and sent to Microsoft
* Java/JVM-specific functionality was removed
* .NET-specific functionalities, such as deploying an ASP.NET web application and more, have been added
